<h1>Problem Statement</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<blockquote>
    A squad of robotic rovers are to be landed by NASA on a plateau on Mars.
    This plateau, which is curiously rectangular, must be navigated by the
    rovers so that their on-board cameras can get a complete view of the
    surrounding terrain to send back to Earth.

    A rover's position and location is represented by a combination of x
    and y co-ordinates and a letter representing one of the four cardinal
    compass points. The plateau is divided up into a grid to simplify
    navigation. An example position might be 0, 0, N, which means the
    rover is in the bottom left corner and facing North.

    In order to control a rover, NASA sends a simple string of letters.
    The possible letters are 'L', 'R' and 'M'. 'L' and 'R' makes the
    rover spin 90 degrees left or right respectively, without moving
    from its current spot. 'M' means move forward one grid point, and
    maintain the same heading.

    Assume that the square directly North from (x, y) is (x, y+1).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The first line of input is the upper-right coordinates of the plateau,
the lower-left coordinates are assumed to be 0,0.

The rest of the input is information pertaining to the rovers that have
been deployed. Each rover has two lines of input. The first line gives
the rover's position, and the second line is a series of instructions
telling the rover how to explore the plateau.  The position is made up
of two integers and a letter separated by spaces, corresponding to the
x and y co-ordinates and the rover's orientation.

Each rover will be finished sequentially, which means that the second
rover won't start to move until the first one has finished moving.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The output for each rover should be its final co-ordinates and heading.
